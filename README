NAME
    Acme::Curse - Remove the blessing that lay on references

SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::Curse qw(curse);

        my $unblessed_ref = curse($object);

DESCRIPTION
    Did you ever want to droo the blessing of an object? Well, now you can:
    Acme::Curse unblesses reference by returning a shallow, non-blessed copy
    of the object.

    Currently only references to scalar, hashes, arrays and code objects can
    be unblessed.

    Exported subs:

    curse
        Unblesses a reference to an object.

BUGS
    None known, but surely there are many.
